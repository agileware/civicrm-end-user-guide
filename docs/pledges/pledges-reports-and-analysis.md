# Pledges Reports and Analysis

## Pledge Reports

CiviCRM comes with two Pledge Reports that are useful when analysing
pledges. The **Pledge Detail Report** includes per contact information
on amount pledged, pledge status, next payment date, balance due, total
amount paid etc. It is based on the **Pledge Report** template. 

The **Pledged But not Paid** report lists pledges which are not
completed and have a due date in the past. The report is based on the
template with the same name. 

These reports has been configured to display particular information but
you can create a new report from the relevant report template to suit
your particular needs. See *Reporting Set-up* for details.

There is also a **Pledge Summary Report** template that could be used to
create a report summarising total pledge amounts per, say, city or month
of initial pledge.
