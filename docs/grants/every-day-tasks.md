# Everyday tasks

This section discusses the every day tasks associated with administering
grants with CiviGrant.

## CiviGrant Dashboard

Go to **Other > Grants > Dashboard** to access the CiviGrant
Dashboard. Here you will see a summary of the grants registered in your
CiviCRM database and a table of recent grant recipients.

## Viewing grants

There are a couple of ways to view grants:

-   The **Grants dashboard** gives a summary of the status of all
    grants in your CiviCRM, grouped by grant type. It also gives an
    overview of recent grants.
-   An individual contact's grants can be viewed from the **Grants** tab
    on their record.

## Adding and editing grant recipients

After Wookie Hole Community Action selected its grant recipients for the
Cave Festival, their grant administrator looked up the contact record of
each successful applicant and entered a new grant record for each one.

To add or edit grant recipients:

1.  Go to **Other > Grants > New Grant**.
2.  Either select an already existing contact or create a new contact to
    whom the grant will be given.
3.  Complete the details of the grant. Fill in as many details as
    possible, including any custom data that has been set up, but you
    can also edit and update the grant details at a later stage.
4.  Click **Save**.

Grants can be edited and updated at any time using the edit link which
appears in the grant record.

## Recording Reports

When reports are received from grant recipients, you can edit the grant
information (either from the CiviGrant dashboard or the contact's
record). Check the **Grant Report Received?** box in the form and add
any appropriate notes.
