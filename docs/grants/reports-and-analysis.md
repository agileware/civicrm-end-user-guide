# Reports and analysis

There are a few techniques for reporting on and analysing grants. The
grant dashboard gives a quick overview of your grant types. Additionally, more information 
about grants can be found from:

-   the Find Grants search form
-   the Grants tab in advanced search
-   the Grant report

## Searching for grant data

CiviCRM makes an important distinction between contacts and grants.
Sometimes it is useful to get the answer to your grant related question
in terms of contacts, e.g. which contacts were successful grant
applicants in 2011. Other times it is more useful to have the answer in
terms of grants, e.g. how many grants applications did we get for our
Community Chest this year? Think about whether you are interested in the
grant or the contact before doing any grant searching.

The Find Grants search allows you to search based on grant data and
return grants. The Advanced search allows you to search based on most
grant data and combine that with other contact information and return
contacts.

Searching based on these criteria gives you access to simple totals. It
also gives the option to export the results as a .CSV file for further analysis.

## Grant reports

Out of the box, CiviCRM comes with one report that can be used for
Grants. This report can be used, for example, to show details for all
grants of a particular type. At the bottom of the report, agregatted statistics
regarding the amounts requested and granted are included.

## More analysis

If you can't do what you want with a built in report or search, consider
commissioning a new report or custom search. Read the [CiviReport](../reporting/what-is-civireport.md) section
for more information.
