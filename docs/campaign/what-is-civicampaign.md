# What is CiviCampaign?

CiviCampaign lets you link together events, mailings, activities, and
contributions under one "umbrella" so that you can track the progress of
all your efforts towards one programmatic goal or campaign. This enables
organizations to measure and analyze the effectiveness of their outreach
and mobilization efforts.

CiviCampaign allows you to:

-   create surveys and petitions
-   record responses to surveys and petitions
-   link activities such as donations, mailings and events to a particular
    campaign
-   track who has voted using Get Out The Vote (GOTV)
-   record individual members' levels of interest and engagement in a
    particular activity.

CiviCampaign is integrated with other CiviCRM components so that you can
select which activities are part of the overall campaign or goal.

For Drupal sites, the CiviEngage module enhances CiviCampaign by
providing a package of custom fields that enable the Survey and Petition
features of CiviCampaign. Read more about CiviEngage in the [Civic Engagement section](../civic-engagement/what-is-civiengage.md).

## Scenario: Year-long mobilization campaign

To kick off a year-long campaign to mobilize community members, the
Townsville Organisation For Tenants (TOFT) held a protest at the
Capitol. The organizers used CiviCampaign to connect all
related activities together over the course of the campaign.

The lead organizer created a campaign called "Mobilize the Masses 2011"
to link a series of related activities including communications about
the mobilizing event, participation and financial contributions for
transport and food during the action.

Using CiviCampaign, the organisers:

-   created a Campaign as the umbrella for all related activities,
    including the duration of the campaign and the revenue goal
-   created a group consisting of the individuals they wanted to target
    for the activities in the campaign
-   called their most active members to help organize other constituents
    in their neighborhoods to participate and recorded the activity
    phone call in the individual's record, indicating the specific
    campaign and the member's response 
-   sent a mass fundraising mailing and indicated the campaign, which
    was then recorded in the contribution information of individuals'
    records
-   created an event to track who would be attending the mobilization,
    and indicated the campaign in the event setup.

Periodically throughout the campaign, the program lead searched all of
the activities related to the campaign and/or individuals who have
activities related to the campaign, to monitor the effectiveness of
their outreach and fundraising efforts, and if necessary adjust
strategies.

Organizers can relate subsequent events, mailings, and other activities
with the same campaign as it proceeds over the course of the year. At
the end of the campaign this information can be reviewed within the
context of the whole campaign.
