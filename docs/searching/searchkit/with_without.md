# With (Optional) / With (Required) / Without 

Put a short 1 - 2 sentence summary of function that will appear in-app on a popup (?) right after the Search For label.

Provide a screenshot showing where on the SearchKit page this clause is.

## Description

Explain the options and what they do to the search results, for example, list each option available in a dropdown and say what each will do, or if list is variable and too long, explain in more abstract terms.

## Option Details

If the section being described has a long list of options that have a one sentence description in the UI then probably start by just listing all of those options in an unordered list.
