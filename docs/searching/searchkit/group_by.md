Use 'Group By' to categorize your data by one or more fields. This results in one row for each value in those fields. This results in summarized information based on your selected criteria.

## Description

'Group By' is a feature that lets you organize data around a common element (entity/ thing). This feature is ideal for analyzing patterns and relationships within your data, such as counting, totalling or avering numeric information or concatenating data in other fields. 

For example, if you're looking at contacts and their addresses, you could for example group them by Contact ID.

If you then also add the field Address Id to the result you will automatically count all addresses on a contact. This approach shows you clearly how many addresses each contact has.

## Option Details

If the section being described has a long list of options that have a one sentence description in the UI then probably start by just listing all of those options in an unordered list.
