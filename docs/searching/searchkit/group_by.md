# Group By 

Put a short 1 - 2 sentence summary of function that will appear in-app on a popup (?) right after the Search For label. To do.

Provide a screenshot showing where on the SearchKit page this clause is.

## Description

'Group By' is a feature that lets you organize data around a common element (entity/ thing). For example, if you're looking at contacts and their addresses, you could for example group them by Contact ID.

If you then also add the field Address Id to the result you will automatically count all addresses on a contact. This approach shows you clearly how many addresses each contact has.

## Option Details

If the section being described has a long list of options that have a one sentence description in the UI then probably start by just listing all of those options in an unordered list.
